Depending on the type of building, selected stats are shown in the description-window in the architect-menu.
This can make it easier to select the best wall for your defence or the right power-generator for your current need.

Each stat can be turned off in the settings if they are not needed.
Can be added/removed from existing save.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist[/url] or buy me a cup of tea.
