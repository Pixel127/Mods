	<description>Mod for customizing stack sizes. As well as the ability to target specific items.

Improvements for v1.0:
 - Stack changes now do NOT require a game reload, if a stack is modified 
   below a set stack size the stack is split up into smaller stacks.
   Should still save your game after every stack size adjustment; because
   if you adjust stacks, dont save, then reload a game, you could lose items.

 - Custom in game menu lets you pick between different modes ( scalar / fixed )
  + scalar : multiplies the base count by the number specified
  + fixed : simply sets the stack size to the number

 - Removed HugsLib dep since the hugs settings is no longer used.

 - Attempted to make it more clear how to set individual overrides
   via the Overrides.xml file.

Load Order:
 - It hopefully won't matter. The stack modification code attempts to run after
   initial processing is complete. But if you have problems. Try moving
   OgreStack to last place.
