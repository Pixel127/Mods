	<description>Enchances pawns' perception of nature.

Simple mod that adjusts beauty and ugly modifiers for terrain and flora. Most notable changes:

- flowers are significantly more beautiful now;
- most trees have beauty increased to 2-4 range. Oak and Teak trees have 5 beauty;
- grass and most bush plants have 1 beauty. Berry plants and healroot have 2 beauty;
- water has overall beauty increased to 4 with ocean cost line having beauty of 6;
- soil, sand and ice get neutral beauty, rich soil gets 1 beauty;
- mud and marsh are really dislikable for the pawns now (-4 and -6 beauty);
- rafflesia is adjusted to -12 beauty to correspond its description;
- chunks and stone blocks are more tolerable with -4 and -6 beauty (against -8 and -12 in Vanilla. Ouch!).
